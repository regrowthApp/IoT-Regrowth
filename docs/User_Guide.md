# User's Guide

This guide aims to explain to the user how to use the android application itself.
The instructions for activiating the arduino-based simulation for users, and editing it (developers)
are explained in depth in the Simulation Guide.

> How to use the application?

The application is fairly simple to use. We will try to explain how to use the app in a youtube video, and will put
the link here once the video is uploaded, and add screenshots if possible.

Youtube tutorial link:

The application is very straightforward and easy to use. After signing up and setting the profile, the farmer can start
adding the animal types that he has in the farm, for each animal type add a list of installed sensors in the farm.
Once that is done, the sensors start to measure data in the farm, and the application home screen is updated instantly.
From there, the farmer can see weight and activity data for each individual animal in a graph, weather data for each
animal type, and averages and statistics for each animal type. As well as recieving notifications automatically if certain
